## Unreal TeamCity Demo

### Overview

This repository contains a simple demonstration of setting up a CI pipeline for building Unreal Engine projects using TeamCity.

This repository includes TeamCity Kotlin DSL settings (.teamcity folder) and two sample game projects: Cropout and Lyra.
Cropout is assumed to be built with the standard vanilla engine version available from the Epic Games Launcher (EGL).
Lyra, on the other hand, is assumed to be built with the Engine from source (Epic's Perforce). 
Due to the size & license constraints, this repository does not contain the Engine source code or the source code of Lyra. 
It serves as a demonstration of project structure and configuration.
